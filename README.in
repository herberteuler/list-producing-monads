Constructing a list with a monad
================================

This contains the code, benchmarks and analysis that belongs to the blog post
<http://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/684-constructing-a-list-in-a-monad-revisited>
which incorporates ideas from
<http://neilmitchell.blogspot.co.uk/2015/09/making-sequencemapm-for-io-take-o1-stack.html> and 
<http://twanvl.nl/blog/haskell/unsafe-sequence>.

Graphs
======

The graph omits some of the less efficient variants, so that details are better visible.

Benchmark results
=================

The table omits those variants with quadratic run time, as I do not want to run them on lists longer than 1000.
